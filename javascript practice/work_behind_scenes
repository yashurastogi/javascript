How java script code runs :

    our code ----- gets executed on javascript engine
      -- firstly code is parsed by parser checking syntax of code to know whether it is correct
      ---parser produces abstract syntax tree 
      --- converted to machine code
      --- then code runs (read by machine )
      
      all javascripts runs in environment (execution context) 
      -- default context is global 
      -- anythijng not inside in any funtion will get exectued 
      --everything gets executed in windows object
      --each time calling function will execute its own context
        --
1. creation phase
   --create variable object
        -- the argument object is created that contains all variables passsed
        
        Hoisting - 
        -- all function declaartions all defined initially
        -- all variable declaartion all are set to undefined and is defined at execution phase 
   --creation of scope chain
        -- only way to create scope is to write functions
        -- also in JS it is lexical funtion 
            -- functions will inherit the properties of its parent function 
        -- locally scoped variables are not avaliable to parents unlsess returned
   -- determine value of this variabl
 2. execution phase
    -- the code of the function that generated the current execution context is run line by line
