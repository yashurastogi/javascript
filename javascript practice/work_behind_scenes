How java script code runs :

    our code ----- gets executed on javascript engine
      -- firstly code is parsed by parser checking syntax of code to know whether it is correct
      ---parser produces abstract syntax tree 
      --- converted to machine code
      --- then code runs (read by machine )
      
      all javascripts runs in environment (execution context) 
      -- default context is global 
      -- anythijng not inside in any funtion will get exectued 
      --everything gets executed in windows object
      --each time calling function will execute its own context
        --
